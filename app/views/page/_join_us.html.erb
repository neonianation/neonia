    <p>Imagine the world 30 years from now. It is the year 2045.<br/><br/>
      
      Humanity is celebrating the 22nd anniversary of world peace, marking the end of the last military conflict over 20 years ago. Ever since, the world has started jointly working towards common goals and collectively advancing human progress. Never before in history was there a period during which research and innovation were aimed exclusively at propelling humanity forward. We are seeing an unprecedented rate of scientific discovery, artistic expression, and technological innovation.<br/><br/>
      
      News are confirming that nature is finally starting to recover from the centuries of environmental exploitation. The ice caps are increasing in surface area, the Great Barrier Reef is flourishing again, and the occurrence of natural disasters is declining. Human beings have begun paying careful attention to maintaining the sustainability of nature that our lives and the lives of our children so essentially depend upon.<br/><br/>
      
      Provision of the basic needs - access to food, water, shelter, education, and health care - for all human beings have become self-evident realities. Poverty, malnutrition, and lack of clean drinking water are all stories of the past. Millions of children grow up every year, encouraged and empowered to pursue their dreams and follow their hearts. People work not out of necessity, but out of desire and passion.<br/><br/>
      
      This is not a world without problems and conflicts. Life would not be life without the gentle ups and downs that accompany our personal journeys. But this is a world without poverty, without malnutrition, without war, and without environmental exploitation. This is a world in which all of humanity thrives and flourishes.
